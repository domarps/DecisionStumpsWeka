- The src directory contains all the code that was witten.
- The data directory contains all the data which is generated during the experiments


For execution ----- 

First change the directory to the hw2 directory

0. In order to generate features (2.a) , execute ./testFeatureGen.sh

1. In order to execute SGD (2.b.i) ,execute ./test_SGD.sh

2. In order to grow Decision Tree with max_depth = -1 (2.b.ii) , execute ./test_Id3.sh

3. In order to grow Decision Tree with max_depth = 4 (2.b.iii) , execute ./test_Id3_DecStump4.sh

4. In order to grow Tree with max_depth = 8 (2.b.iv), execute ./test_Id3_DecStump8.sh

5. In order to execute Decision Stumps with SGD (2.b.v), execute ./test_DecStumpsSGD.sh



                       ---------Description of shell scripts------------
- testFeatureGen.sh: A shell script that runs the feature generator
- test_SGD.sh:  A shell script that runs the will compile and execute the SGD implementation of the problem set
- test_Id3.sh:  A shell script that grows the Decision Tree of infinite Depth
- test_Id3_DecStump4.sh: A shell script that grows the Decision Stump of Depth = 4
- test_Id3_DecStump8.sh: A shell script that grows the Decision Stump of Depth = 8
- test_DecStumpsSGD.sh: A shell script that grows the Decision Stump of Depth = 4, feeding the features to the SGD algorithm



			--------- src/cs446/weka/classifiers/trees/ ---------------------

This contains the java sources. Here is a brief description of the contents of the  directory with the source files :
   1. FeatureGenerator.java: A feature generator that generates features in the ARFF format(file stored in hw2/data/.
   2. Id3.java : The baseline implementation given to develop Tree of maxDepth = -1
   3. Id3Tester.java : The API for performing crossValidation,evaluation and result calculation for tree of infinite Depth.
   4. Id3DecStump4Tester.java :  The API for performing crossValidation,evaluation and result calculation for tree of Depth = 4
   5. Id3DecStump8Tester.java :  The API for performing crossValidation,evaluation and result calculation for tree of Depth = 8
   6. SGDTester.java : The API for performing crossValidation,evaluation and result calculation for the SGD algorithm
   7. SGD.java : The actual implementation of the SGD Algorithm 

	                       ----------- data/  -------------------

myBadges.arff : This contains the arff file generated from FeatureGenerator.java 
 
- lib: This contains the weka.jar corresponding to Weka v3.6.3
-  Makefile: A makefile to compile the java code
- bin: This contains the classes generated from the compilation of the Java source codes
